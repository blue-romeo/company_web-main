Deployment Guide: Hosting on Netlify
Netlify provides a simple and fast way to deploy your static website directly from a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).

Step 1: Push Your Code to a Git Repository
Make sure all your website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) are committed and pushed to a new or existing repository on a platform like GitHub.

Step 2: Sign Up or Log In to Netlify
Go to https://www.netlify.com and sign up for a free account or log in.

Step 3: Connect Your Git Repository
On your Netlify dashboard, click the "Add new site" button.

Select "Import an existing project."

Choose your Git provider (e.g., GitHub). You will be prompted to authorize Netlify.

Select the repository that contains your website's code.

Step 4: Configure Your Deploy Settings
Netlify will automatically detect your project, but it's good practice to confirm the settings:

Branch to deploy: main (or whichever branch you want to deploy from).

Build command: Leave this blank. Since this is a static site with no build process, no command is needed.

Publish directory: Leave this blank. The default is your repository's root directory, which is what you want.

Step 5: Deploy the Site
Click the "Deploy site" button. Netlify will now automatically build and deploy your website. You can watch the progress in the log. Once complete, you will be given a temporary URL for your new live site.

Step 6: (Optional) Set a Custom Domain
You can link your own domain name to your Netlify site from the "Domain management" settings.

Local Development
To run this project locally, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. No special server or build process is required.
